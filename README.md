## hyper modularity process

+ Split the smallest possible reusable elements


# modularity vs hyper modularity

+ perfectionism in modularization 
+ simplify to the limit
+ give independence
+ that it should be still usefull 


## What is an application

An apllication is a program with an interface


## What is an interface

An interface is a first layer to interact with an logic program.


## What is a module

+ an application extension
+ works inside application


## What is a library

it's a defined and good designed generic function/helper or many function focused on specific area 


## Helper

Helper it's small generic part in context of program


## What is a package

It's an independent library to be use in a program



## What is the different between Modularisation and hyper modularisation

modularization is focusing on *grouping* the generic parts 
while hyper modularization is focusing on *splitting* the specific parts



## Hyper modularity 

+ it's not just about grouping as model,
+ it's not just about extract small independent generic parts 
+ its' about the best solution for specific usage


## hyper modularity 

huge result wiht litlle energy involved.
+ that's the leverage mechanism 



# [HyperModularity](https://www.hypermodularity.com/)

Hypermodularity is an attractive principle for software and hardware architecture

+ e.g. by assembling a infrastructure of organisation from a large amount of elements
 


# why make a modularisation 

+ To provide a clear separation of concerns for the application's functionality
+ To easily implement app performance upgrades like code splitting and AoT compilation

In fact, modularization is now such an important part of building web apps that Angular requires you to architect your applications with it out of the box!

While AngularJS also had a module system, it was often ignored by developers as it often didn't provide enough advantages to make it completely necessary.



## some of the benefits:

+ the customized bricks are tested and ready to use
+ production cost are significantly decreased 
+ reliability of the system is increased due to fewer single points of failure. 


## Modularization â€“ Satisfy Customers and Decrease Costs


Modularization is a method that can be employed during the product development process to create innovative products that customers love, while keeping production costs low. 
Key to a modular, customizable product is to identify which are the functions and parts of the product that are noticed and important to the customers. 
The rest of the product should be kept standard for as many product lines as possible.
That way you can offer your customers choices and give them a feeling of having this unique product they were looking for, while saving big in the background.

## Definition of Modularity in Software Architecture

Modularity is a way to extract each part of code, such functions as a generic part instead of group related code together.
Most languages have modularity structures, such as packages in Java, with hypermodularity we based ons separated functions.




# Hypermodularity on monolith


## Packages, Dependencies, Classes

based on packages and namespaces the Classnames are overrided, but not each function/class method can be overrided.
So we should based on sperated functions to make it.

Going forward with such idea it's better to create each function separatly.

In another way, The Architects need to be aware of how products are packaged by developers and it has major architectural consequences. 
For example, if many packages are closely coupled together, it becomes more difficult to reuse one of them.


## Modular Reuse Before Classes

After "structured programming languages" era software developers started working with object-oriented languages,
today there are so many different separation schemes, so
it's easier to make one step forward to functional without some abstarctions such classes.

Modula and Ada had a module programming structure, just like today's packages or namespaces.

Object-oriented programming languages became popular when new ways of reusing code were introduced.


## Modularity in practice

A term used to describe code grouping is modularity.

hyper modularization is the process of extracting the code into the smallest possible parts, e.g. extracting functions from classes meeting the expectations of "Single Responisbility" and "Dependency Injection" 

From a simplicity standpoint, grouping a large number of classes together in a monolithic application can make sense. However, when the time comes for the architecture to be restructured, the coupling becomes an obstacle to breaking the monolith apart. For software artifacts, such as components, classes, and so on, developers also need qualified names to differentiate different software artifacts from each other to reduce conflict.



## The shared module

In the next chapter we're going to cover a critical type of module that you'll need to create in any reasonably sized application: the shared module.





# Hypermodularity on services layer



##  Modularized and decentralized architecture based on micro- and nano- services.

+ Nanoservices
+ Microservices
+ Devops
+ Architecture


## microservices -> nanoservices

What is the differend

On microservices we are working with packages and many classes to build some independent part osf system which can be independet service
+ DB
+ Auth
+ + roles

## layers

With more advanced servcies with independent latyer for auuthorisation, API, ...
We can just create one by one FaaS Functions as a Service using all of layers

We call it annoservices


The nanoservices based on existing infrastructure


# Packages modularity


## modulrity in existing packages

how to make it step by step

how to extract from one packages all of functions?
