# [HyperModularity](https://www.hypermodularity.com/)

Hypermodularity is an attractive principle for software and hardware architecture.

Infrastructure of an organisation 

+ e.g by assembling the infrastructure of an organisation from a large amount of elements.
 
 
 
Hypermodularity it's about processes (object) not about processes (verb.)

Hypermodularisation it's a continouous process focused on atomisation the architecture of system.


I'ts like a rain-worm, you cutted it in the pieces and it still functions, but at a higher level

You get a smaller part with the same functionality.

And with smaller size are comming such benefits:
+ precize
+ more functionality

What if i get more functionality at the same size.


We atomize the objects to bring it to make them more specialised.

and it's a sinn to atomize something's only if you can 


The all questions are about hyper modularity.


What we want to get is the increease quality.


```
Imagine your Company that is doing better service, automatic every day Based on
Industry 4.0 and global communication based on 5g and 6g, which can
grow without borders and continuously every day, hour and second.
```

With Continous hypermodularity we are going to defined smaller and better processes, that can work togheter without stopping them on the stream!

## Definition of Modularity in Software Architecture

Modularity is a way to extract each part of code, such functions as a generic part instead of group related code together.
Most languages have modularity structures, such as packages in Java, with hypermodularity we based ons separated functions.


## Why make a Modularization 

+ To provide a clear separation of concerns for the application's functionality
+ To easily implement app performance upgrades like code splitting and AoT compilation

In fact, modularization is now such an important part of building web apps that Angular requires you to architect your applications with it out of the box!

While AngularJS also had a module system, it was often ignored by developers as it often didn't provide enough advantages to make it completely necessary.



## Benefits of Modularization

+ the customized bricks are tested and ready to use
+ production cost are significantly decreased 
+ reliability of the system is increased due to fewer single points of failure. 


## Satisfy Customers and Decrease Costs

Modularization is a method that can be employed during the product development process to create innovative products that customers love, while keeping production costs low. 
Key to a modular, customizable product is to identify which are the functions and parts of the product that are noticed and important to the customers. 
The rest of the product should be kept standard for as many product lines as possible.
That way you can offer your customers choices and give them a feeling of having this unique product they were looking for, while saving big in the background.

# Modularity vs Hyper modularity

+ perfectionism in modularization 
+ simplify to the limit
+ give independence
+ that it should be still usefull 


## What is an application

An apllication is a program with an interface


## What is an Interface

An interface is a first layer to interact with an logic program.


## What is a Module

+ an application extension
+ works inside application


## What is a Library

it's a defined and good designed generic function/helper or many function focused on specific area 


## What is a Helper

Helper it's small generic part in context of program


## What is a Package

It's an independent library to be use in a program



# Hyper modularity process


+ Split the smallest possible reusable elements

## What is the different between Modularisation and hyper modularisation

modularization is focusing on *grouping* the generic parts 
while hyper modularization is focusing on *splitting* the specific parts



## What is a Hyper modularity 

+ it's not just about grouping as model,
+ it's not just about extract small independent generic parts 
+ its' about the best solution for specific usage


## Hyper modularity results

huge result wiht litlle energy involved.
+ that's the leverage mechanism 
Cost reduction, lifetime design, and radical hypermodularity, are some of our keys to maximizing platform scalability towards

# Hypermodularity on monolith


## Packages, Dependencies, Classes

based on packages and namespaces the Classnames are overrided, but not each function/class method can be overrided.
So we should based on sperated functions to make it.

Going forward with such idea it's better to create each function separatly.

In another way, The Architects need to be aware of how products are packaged by developers and it has major architectural consequences. 
For example, if many packages are closely coupled together, it becomes more difficult to reuse one of them.


## Modular Reuse Before Classes

After "structured programming languages" era software developers started working with object-oriented languages,
today there are so many different separation schemes, so
it's easier to make one step forward to functional without some abstarctions such classes.

Modula and Ada had a module programming structure, just like today's packages or namespaces.

Object-oriented programming languages became popular when new ways of reusing code were introduced.


## Modularity in practice

A term used to describe code grouping is modularity.

hyper modularization is the process of extracting the code into the smallest possible parts, e.g. extracting functions from classes meeting the expectations of "Single Responisbility" and "Dependency Injection" 

From a simplicity standpoint, grouping a large number of classes together in a monolithic application can make sense. However, when the time comes for the architecture to be restructured, the coupling becomes an obstacle to breaking the monolith apart. For software artifacts, such as components, classes, and so on, developers also need qualified names to differentiate different software artifacts from each other to reduce conflict.



## The shared module

In the next chapter we're going to cover a critical type of module that you'll need to create in any reasonably sized application: the shared module.





# Hypermodularity on services layer



##  Modularized and decentralized architecture based on micro- and nano- services.

+ Nanoservices
+ Microservices
+ Devops
+ Architecture


## microservices -> nanoservices

What is the differend

On microservices we are working with packages and many classes to build some independent part osf system which can be independet service
+ DB
+ Auth
+ + roles

## layers

With more advanced servcies with independent latyer for auuthorisation, API, ...
We can just create one by one FaaS Functions as a Service using all of layers

We call it annoservices


The nanoservices based on existing infrastructure


# Packages modularity

11 Principles Supported by Softreck's Extreme Manufacturing

The Test Driven Design aspect and Contract First Manufacturing are unique

## Contract-First Design
design the interface to other modules before designing the module
   
## Test Driven Development
design a series of tests that determines whether it will work, prior to doing design work
   
## Extreme Learning
in order to further a zero-waste development process, we focuses on training in practice, we produce lean instructionals intended for rapid learning.
This means that we optimize existing instructionals to facilitate the learning curve of advanced development techniques - especially with the interest of bringing people up to speed from zero. We like working with rapid-learning novices, as such people can become effective without the industrial inertia (old and prejudiced design ideas).
   
## Optimize for change
agility, adaptability of design is foremost to achieve desired result (complete, functional, minimal viable product)
   
## Object-Oriented, Modular Architecture
Modularity allows build a large system in parallel, as long as all the interfaces are well-defined for the modules. 
Modularity allows for a complete Product Ecology to emerge - for closed-loop manufacturing cycles. 
Modular architecture allows us to optimize 'borrowing' from other projects such that the development process is globally collaborative.
   
## Iterate the Design
Create the test that your design should pass.
Create the simplest design possible that enables the test to pass.
Improve the design to be simpler or more elegant.  Repeat this process ("Iterate on the design") until improving this component is no longer the highest value work you can do.
   
## Agile Hardware Design Patterns
wrapper (interface to the interface), common materials, tech recursion (invest in tools that make components and that make materials), 
Lifetime Design (so that hardware can be repaired easily)
   
## Continuous Integration Development
iterate continuously between product test, design, and manufacturing. This involves Design for Manufacturing, Design for Disassembly, Design for Fabricability, Design for Maintainability.
Product Service Systems allows testing as a scalable enterprise model for open source hardware.
Our current beta testing for build efficiency of this model is ongoing with our 
Extreme Manufacturing Workshops.
   
## Continuously Deployed Development
How to go to market fast? Flexible Fabrication concept. Digital fabrication assist. Open Design. Open Source R&D capacity, rapid prototyping, integrated R&D lab a la Edison.

## Scaling Patterns 
Create teams for each module. Teams can work in parallel. Multiple teams can work on same module. Different teams can work on different aspects - design, build, documentation, prototyping, testing. Teams should have open communication channels, such as Work Log on our wiki or Dozuki structure, or video uploads, plus Forums, Stack Exchange, Design Sprints, and Leader Training Workshops. 

## Workshops Team and Customer
Scrum of Scrums, Product Owner and Scrum Maseter. Clear Customer Visible Value is generated and iterated. 
Chief Product Owner (CPO) sequences and refines the Portfolio Product Backlog continuously.
User stories are the requirements. Scrum Masters negotiate with other Scrum Masters for resources. 
All work completed satisfies the quality metric called the Definition of Done. Product owner maintains backlog and clarity. Scrum master maintains transparency of product delivery via documentation. Global remote effort can be maintained by heavy documentation typical of Open Source. 

## Documentation Flow
Heavy Documentation is Key to a Lean Process - which appears counterintuitive at first but is relevant to solving wicked problems.

## Partner Patterns
Easy sourcing from many partners. Wrapper is key to this flexibility - an interface of the interface design. 
Design collaboration with industry. 
University Collaborations for R&D. 
Wide portfolio of Freelancers to do design, build, and service along a Product Service System model.

## Network

 Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules. Modularity is often used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks. However, it has been shown that modularity suffers a resolution limit and, therefore, it is unable to detect small communities. Biological networks, including animal brains, exhibit a high degree of modularity. 
 

## Abstraction and AI

abstraction is depends context, so it can be good in some context, not ewerywhere, that's why I support personally Native Technologies, Microsoftsolutions are full of abstractions, but AI don't need it, so what is the future?
AI or Microsoft?


## Modularity is the king

That's why with modularity we can handle AI skills to build us better technology world, wit rapidly development and documented such describing world with words


### for abstraction friends

There is nothing wrong if abstraction is describing business logic for a human.
We need it till AI is not used to create hypermodular application by itself.
If AI is responsible for streaming application there si no more necessary to create abstraction.

What AI need?
native modular code written in native technologies.
AI is build the businnes logic over personalisation based on BIG DATA
It works such Black BOX with:
+ input
+ output
+ config
